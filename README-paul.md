# Build yourself a PyScript

## Intro


## Get Python

## Simplest Example

- (N) Show inline demo
- (N) Remarkable deployment story for Python!
- (P) Remarkable if you're on wifi
  - Show some bar charts about download, memory, TTI
  - Good for apps, not sites
- (N) True, but let's not discount the size of that market
- (N) Besides...

## MicroPython

- (N) We can do MicroPython!
  - Inline example
- (N) Look at those numbers!
  - Show updated bar chart comparison
- (P) Ok, that's compelling, but...
- (P) If you know what either of these are...
  - Show Lighthouse, Page Speed
- (P) Then this isn't enough
- (P) But you got me, that moves the demarcation line a LOT
- (N) Lots of activity on this, come see us in the booth
  - Maybe flash screenshots of any announcements

## Python Context

- (P) If you want to make a PyScript...
- (P) You're atop a bunch of layers, like...

## Interpreters!

- (P) Interpreters!
  - Show and explain CPython 3.11 WASM announcement
- (N) MicroPython
  - Inline demo
- (N) Choice is good, but your PyScript clone will have to support it
  - Inline showing `<py-config>`

## WASM Build Tool

- (N) Emscripten
- (P) Zython

## WASM Integration
 
- (N) Pyodide
  - Bells and whistles, very active
  - Mention Hood now with Anaconda
- (P) Zython
  - Doesn't use emscripten, doesn't target browsers

## Packaging

- (N) Pyodide's micropip
- (P) There's also the question of WASM wheels and sizes
- (P) And what does "virtual environment" even mean in this context?

## Performance "Budget"

- (P) 3G feature phone in countryside: TTI, memory, battery
- (N) Mobile web is *a* priority, but not exclusive
- (P) True, but Page Rank gets influenced by these factors
